# KMSE

KMSE (KeyDecoder's Master System Emulator) is an emulator for Sega Master System console, written in C#, focused on the Mark II.  This is just a fun research project emulating my favorite console.

As a child of the 80s/90s, I played the Master System so much growing up.  Loved playing Alex Kidd in Miracle World which was built into the console (I can still remember the Janken combinations of each boss).

There is so much great information out there on Master System and Z80 emulation.

http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/mastersystem.html - A great tutorial that helped me understand the basics and get something up and running

https://github.com/maxim-zhao/zexall-sms - Amazing SMS port of ZXALL for exercising the Z80 emulation

https://www.smspower.org/Development/Documents - SMS Power Development Resources, huge amount of documentation on there (and shoutout to everyone who contributed it, it's amazing)

https://github.com/sklivvz/z80 - C# Z80 CPU emulation I used as a reference/basis for my implementation

I also used some other Emulators as a reference
